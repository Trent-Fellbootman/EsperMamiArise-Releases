# Notice

**This game is under active development. Currently, only the tutorial level and the first level are available.** Expect new levels, game mechanics and more being added continuously!

## Features

Use teleportation, telekinesis (move objects by mind), Esper vision (see stuff through walls) and more psychic powers to rescue your abducted boyfriend and uncover a secret research project!

## Credits

This game is a homage to Esper Mami, a work by the great manga writer Fujiko 路 F 路 Fujio. Despite being the highest-quality anime I've seen, it has been abandoned for almost 36 years. I've always wanted to see new content from Esper Mami; well, making some up myself was always an option.

Fun facts:

- I drew the cutscene comics myself.
- I'm the guy saying "Achieved with Unreal Engine 5" in the opening video.

## Supported Languages

English, Chinese and Japanese (AI-translated with manual proofreading) are supported.

## Troubleshooting

This game currently does NOT auto-detect optimal graphics settings; to avoid hiccups, I recommend setting all graphics options to "low" in the main menu before entering the first level, and figure out the quality settings that works on your computer when you're in the level.

- This game is currently a demo. There's no more content after you open the gate to the underground facility in level 1.
- If you don't know how to move to the next manga in cutscenes: just left-click anywhere.
- Level 1 is dark. Press X to toggle flashlight.
- This game does support gamepad but the keys are not covered in the tutorial. You'll quickly figure out which gamepad buttons does what just by trying out the common buttons.
